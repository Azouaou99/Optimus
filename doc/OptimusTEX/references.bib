  abstract="The classical filtering and prediction problem is re-examined using the Bode-Shannon representation of random processes and the “state-transition” method of analysis of dynamic systems. New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite-memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.",

  abstract="Summary This paper presents a novel nonlinear finite element (FE) model updating framework, in which advanced nonlinear structural FE modeling and analysis techniques are used jointly with the extended Kalman filter (EKF) to estimate time-invariant parameters associated to the nonlinear material constitutive models used in the FE model of the structural system of interest. The EKF as a parameter estimation tool requires the computation of structural FE response sensitivities (total partial derivatives) with respect to the material parameters to be estimated. Employing the direct differentiation method, which is a well-established procedure for FE response sensitivity analysis, facilitates the application of the EKF in the parameter estimation problem. To verify the proposed nonlinear FE model updating framework, two proof-of-concept examples are presented. For each example, the FE-simulated response of a realistic prototype structure to a set of earthquake ground motions of varying intensity is polluted with artificial measurement noise and used as structural response measurement to estimate the assumed unknown material parameters using the proposed nonlinear FE model updating framework. The first example consists of a cantilever steel bridge column with three unknown material parameters, while a three-story three-bay moment resisting steel frame with six unknown material parameters is used as second example. Both examples demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed parameter estimation framework even in the presence of high measurement noise. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.",

  volume="6",

  year="2020",
  abstract="Ensemble Kalman filters are powerful tools to merge model dynamics and observation data. For large system models, they are known to diverge due to subsampling errors at small ensemble size and thus possible spurious correlations in forecast error covariances. The Local Ensemble Transform Kalman filter (LETKF) remedies these disadvantages by localization in observation space. However, its application to nonlocal observations is still under debate since it is still not clear how to optimally localize nonlocal observations. The present work studies intermittent divergence of filter innovations and shows that it increases forecast errors. Nonlocal observations enhance such innovation divergence under certain conditions, whereas similar localization radius and sensitivity function width of nonlocal observations minimizes the divergence rate. The analysis of the LETKF reveals inconsistencies in the assimilation of observed and unobserved model grid points which may yield detrimental effects. These inconsistencies inter alia indicate that the localization radius should be larger than the sensitivity function width if spatially synchronized system activity is expected. Moreover, the shift of observation power from observed to unobserved grid points hypothesized in the context of catastrophic filter divergence is supported for intermittent innovation divergence. Further possible mechanisms yielding such innovation divergence are ensemble member alignment and a novel covariation between background perturbations in location and observation space.",
